## Intro
 * A1: This project was developed to simulate and analyze a Limit Order Book (LOB) in R. Each function is designed to manage and analyze the limit order book, offering various insights and operations.
 * A2: This project is a whole R-based backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies. It uses historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data to simulate trades and calculate the performance of a given strategy. Finally, forward testing is used to check the robustness of the strategy.
